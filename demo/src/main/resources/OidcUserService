so it is like the openIdConnect provider like google will give a authorization code after they verify their account from google side.. the oidcuserservice takes the info send by google and extracts user info and helps to store it in the security context of spring application am i right?

Yes, that's correct! Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. User Authentication with Google (OpenID Connect Provider):
When a user tries to log in using Google (acting as the OpenID Connect provider), they are redirected to Google's login page.
The user logs in with their Google credentials, and Google verifies their identity.
2. Authorization Code:
After successfully logging in, Google redirects the user back to your Spring Boot application.
Along with this redirect, Google sends an authorization code to your application.
3. Token Exchange:
Your Spring Boot application (via Spring Security) automatically uses this authorization code to request an ID token and an access token from Google.
The ID token contains information about the user (e.g., name, email) in a secure, signed format.
4. OidcUserService Role:
The OidcUserService is then invoked to handle this ID token and, if needed, to fetch additional user information from Google's UserInfo endpoint.
The service extracts the user's details, such as their name, email, and other profile information, from the ID token and/or UserInfo endpoint.
5. Security Context:
After extracting the user information, OidcUserService creates an OidcUser object that encapsulates this data.
This OidcUser object is stored in the Security Context of your Spring Boot application.
The Security Context is a part of Spring Security that holds information about the current authenticated user and their roles/permissions.
6. Accessing User Information:
Once the user is authenticated, you can access their information in your application through the Security Context.
This allows your application to know who the user is and what roles/permissions they have, enabling secure access to protected resources.
